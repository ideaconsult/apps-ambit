Ambit-SMIRKS
============

Ambit-SMIRKS is an extension of the [Ambit-SMARTS](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/minf.201100028/abstract) Java library, both part of the [AMBIT project](http://ambit.sf.net)


The SMIRKS module is used to enable metabolite predictions in [Toxtree](http://toxtree.sourceforge.net),
once that site of metabolisms are predicted by [SMARTCyp](http://www.farma.ku.dk/smartcyp/)
 

Main functionality
------------------

(1) Parsing of [SMIRKS linear notations](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smirks/) into internal reaction (transformation) representations based on [The Chemistry Development Kit](http://cdk.sf.net) objects 

(2) Application of the stored reactions against target molecules for actual transformation of the target chemical objects
